# Caesar-Cipher
Simple implementation of Caesar Cipher using GUI toolkit in python

Caesar Cipher is one of the most well-known and straightforward encryption methods in cryptography. The shift Cipher, Caesar's Cipher, Caesar shift, and Caesar's code, are some of its alternate names. Plain text is encrypted using this encryption method so that only the intended recipient can decipher it.
It's a very simple method. Here basic GUI toolkit is used to encrypt or decrypt the message entered by the user.
